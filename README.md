# ACC-Race-Control-Extension-Example
An example for how to create an extension for ACC Race Control

# How to build
## Tools:
I use Netbeans 14 to edit code and OpenJDK 13.
The project is build with gradle. A wrapper version is included in this and the base repository. No need to install gradle itself.

## Build:
Clone the base repository here https://github.com/LennysLounge/ACC-Race-Control.
Open it in a terminal and run the commands `./gradlew.bat build` and `./gradlew.bat install`.
The First command builds the project and the seconds installs the dependency into a local maven repository.

Clone this repository and open it in a terminal.
Run `./gradlew.bat build` and then `./gradlew.bat run`.
